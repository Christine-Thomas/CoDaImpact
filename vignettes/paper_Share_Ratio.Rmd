The details for most of the mathematical tools implemented by **CoDaImpact** are developed in the article "*Pairwise share-ratio interpretations of compositional regression models"* by Dargel and Thomas-Agnan (2023).
The article is [currently available as a working paper](https://www.tse-fr.eu/sites/default/files/TSE/documents/doc/wp/2023/wp_tse_1456.pdf) and all its numerical results can be reproduced following the instructions on the [dedicated GitHub repository](https://github.com/LukeCe/paper_Share_Ratio).

The article is accompanied by a vignette that provides additional illustrations for using **CoDaImpact** based on a case study of electoral sociology that analyses the 2022 French presidential elections.
